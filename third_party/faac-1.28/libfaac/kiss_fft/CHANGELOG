1.2.1 (April 4, 2004) 
    compiles cleanly with just about every -W warning flag under the sun

    reorganized kiss_fft_state so it could be read-only/const. This may be useful for embedded systems
    that are willing to predeclare twiddle factors, factorization.

    Fixed C_MUL,S_MUL on 16-bit platforms.

    tmpbuf will only be allocated if input & output buffers are same
    scratchbuf will only be allocated for ffts that are not multiples of 2,3,5
 
    NOTE: The tmpbuf,scratchbuf changes may require synchronization code for multi-threaded apps.


1.2 (Feb 23, 2004)
    interface change -- cfg object is forward declaration of struct instead of void*
    This maintains type saftey and lets the compiler warn/error about stupid mistakes.
            (prompted by suggestion from Erik de Castro Lopo)

    small speed improvements

    added psdpng.c -- sample utility that will create png spectrum "waterfalls" from an input file
        ( not terribly useful yet)

1.1.1 (Feb 1, 2004 )
    minor bug fix -- only affects odd rank, in-place, multi-dimensional FFTs

1.1 : (Jan 30,2004)
    split sample_code/ into test/ and tools/

    Removed 2-D fft and added N-D fft (arbitrary)

    modified fftutil.c to allow multi-d FFTs

    Modified core fft routine to allow an input stride via kiss_fft_stride()
    (eased support of multi-D ffts)

    Added fast convolution filtering (FIR filtering using overlap-scrap method, with tail scrap)

    Add kfc.[ch]: the KISS FFT Cache. It takes care of allocs for you ( suggested by Oscar Lesta ).

1.0.1 (Dec 15, 2003)
    fixed bug that occurred when nfft==1
    
1.0 : (Dec 14, 2003)
    changed kiss_fft function from using a single buffer, to two buffers.
    If the same buffer pointer is supplied for both in and out, kiss will
    manage the buffer copies.

    added kiss_fft2d and kiss_fftr as separate source files (declarations in kiss_fft.h )

0.4 :(Nov 4,2003) optimized for radix 2,3,4,5

0.3 :(Oct 28, 2003) woops, version 2 didn't actually factor out any radices other than 2

0.2 :(Oct 27, 2003) added mixed radix, only radix 2,4 optimized versions

0.1 :(May 19 2003)  initial release, radix 2 only
